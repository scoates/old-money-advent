December 9: 9.0-9.9%ABV (or under 4.99% ABV)

It's Monday. You might need a big beer. Or you might need to start off your week a little lighter. Either way, it's still Monday. Today, share a 9%+ beer, or one under 5%. And get ready for 10-year-tomorrow. 

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
