December 20: 2-Orvals

Day 2-O! Today is special to me (some of you may know that I have a small—but larger than many—Orval collection), and hopefully also special to other OMTs. Today we drink two different vintages of Orval, to see how it changes over time. Really looking forward to these tasting notes. Oh, and in an effort to include more people, also accepted the current-vintage Orval (whatever you can buy), but I request that you pour two bottles into one glass; IT'S FRIDAY AND THE HOLIDAYS, after all.

To participate, drink *two* beers today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
