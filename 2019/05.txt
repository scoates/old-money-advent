December 5: 5 Years Old

Pull out any beer that's five years old (hopefully it's Old Money). I know we don't all have 5 year old beers kicking around, but if you don't, your homework for today is to go to the closest respectable beer store and buy two bottles of Orval marked 2019. Then put one away somewhere dark and cool and don't touch it until Old Money Advent 2024, and drink the other for today's Advent. (Or, failing all of that, just pick a beer you wish was five years old, and share that with us; hopefully you have anotehr still in the cellar.) For those of us that do have some old dusties kicking around, here's your excuse.

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
