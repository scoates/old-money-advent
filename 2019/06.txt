December 6: 6.0-6.9%ABV

These next few days are intentionally easy so everyone can join in. Today is any old money beer that's between 6% and 7% ABV. I'm hoping that we see some old favourites come out this weekend. Happy Friday, tickers!

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
