December 18: Kriek or Framboise

Lambics day two. Today is just like yesterday, except instead of unfruited lambics, we're doing fruited lambics. Traditionally this is Kriek (cherry) or Framboise (raspberry), but there are definitely some Old Money bottles that use other fruit, and those are cool, too. Let's see what you've got!

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
