C is for… well… lots of Old Money. Today, pick out a favourite bottle of Dave, Dogfish, Deschutes, De Dolle, Dupont, Dieu du Ciel, or anything else with D. Easy weekend beers. (-:

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
