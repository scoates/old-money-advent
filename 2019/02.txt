December 2: Dubbel, Doppelbock, or OM Double IPA

Drink a dubbel, down a doppelbock, or… uh… douse your tongue with double IPA—either old money, or *actually* old. Dig through the pile to find these newly-neglected styles and remind us all how satisfying brown belgians and 'ator-named lagers can be.

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
