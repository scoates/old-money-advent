December 24: Swing that Whale

Okay, friends: it is here. Whale day. We've intentionally tried to keep this thing inclusive to those of us who don't have extensive cellars (not always successfully), and today is no different—whales can mean different things to everyone. But if you've got it, swing it today. Bring out your whales!

(It's been fun hanging out with all of you every day. What a great December of tasting and clearing out the cellar, it's been. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all of you and your families.)

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
