December 7: 7.0-7.9%ABV

Continuing with the increasing alcohol series is another day when everyone who wants to can participate. Anything between 7% and 8% ABV today. Something you've been waiting on and needed an excuse; something you've been afraid to open and needed an excuse; something you've been wanting to buy and needed an excuse… 

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
