December 17: Gueuze/Unfruited Lambic

Finally, into the Lambics. Today, we're drinking straight lambic and gueuze (…and faro, if you've got it, I suppose). Any lambic that doesn't have fruit, really. Dig through and see what you can find; hopefully many of you Americans can find Cuvée René turding on gas station shelves. All of it is old money, as far as I'm concerned (just… some of it might be backsweetened and that's gross… but still not new money (-: ).

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
