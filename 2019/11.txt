December 11: Amlam (American "Lambic" or other non-Lambic sour)

The letter series starts today. Here's your chance to show off old and/or forgotten "Amlam". Ideally American-brewed beers in the tradition of actual Lambics, but you're good with any non-Lambic sour. There's been lots of talk of Cascade lately…

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
