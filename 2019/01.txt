December 1: Old Money Advent starts today!

Today’s theme is: Old Money Batch 1.

Raid the cellar for the first batch of beers that were tick whales (or not!) back in the day. There’s got to be a B1 Beatification or B1 KtG out there, right? An oldschool corked La Folie, or a questionable growler of 2002 Dark Lord, covertly poured while the bar staff was wrecked on their own supply? Or maybe even better: a local favourite that has thrived under the test of time, that maybe the rest of us have never heard about.

To participate, just post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
