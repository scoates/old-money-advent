December 22: Imperial Stouts

Ah, Old Money: when Imperial Stouts were Imperial Stouts! When they didn't necessarily need to be barrel aged, and they definitely weren't full of cookies (well, okay… at least not *most* of the time). The logical progression of yesterday's barleywines are today's imperial stouts. Crack something classic, and share!

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
