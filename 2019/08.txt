December 8: 8.0-8.9%ABV

More continuing with the increasing alcohol series. Lots of people said they had trouble finding a 7% beer for yesterday, but their cellars were overflowing with 8% beers. Welcome to advent week 2. Let's do this.

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
