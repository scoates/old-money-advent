December 12: Belgian OM

The second of the letter series: B is for Belgium. Hopefully, unlike what happened yesterday, we can all agree that Belgium exists, and that it is at least—in part—Old Money. Hopefully, today, everyone who wants to can participate. Drink your OM Belgian beers and show us.

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
