December 10: Ten years old

Ten year Tuesday! Or something… Today we're breaking out beers labeled 2009 (brewed on, bottled on, sharpied on even; anything goes). I know not everyone can participate, so don't worry about it if you can't—just like on the 5th, drink something you wish was 10 years old and post anyway.

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
