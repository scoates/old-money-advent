December 4: OM Quadrupel (or your biggest Belgian)

Quad day! Back before no one blinked an eye at 11% ABV, seven pounds of fruit per pint, sour mashed, kettle soured, lactose milkshake cans, we had our own "extreme" beers—and they were even enjoyed by people who like the taste of beer. When you're in for the night, break out your Belgian Quadrupels and share a sip with the rest of us.

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
