December 15: Rauchbier or something equally as ðŸ”¥

By request of Mr. Morse, today is Rauchbier day. And in the spirit of participation, let's also include anything with any sort of smoke character, as long as it's Old Money. (I'm looking at YOU, kettle soured smoked imperial black berliner weiÃŸeâ€”just no.) Let's see how those long-cellared smoked beers have held up over time. Keep it ðŸ”¥.

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you donâ€™t have something that matches the theme, donâ€™t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
