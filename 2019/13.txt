December 13: Californian OM

C is for California. Probably a little more restrictive than Belgium (Pretty sure the only Californian beers I can buy, here in Montreal, are FiftyFifty Eclipse from 2017), but should still be pretty wide open to participants. Bring out your Yellow Bus (or at least your Racer 5).

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
