December 3: Tripel, or OM Triple IPA

Treat thyself to a tipple of tripel… okay, I'm done with the aliteration—it was a stretch, even yesterday. Show us your huge citrusy IPAs from before they got loaded up with fruit and glop, and break out your big blonde Belgians (…there I go again).

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
