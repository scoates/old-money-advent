December 21: Barleywine

We're back to one beer today, for the solstice. The winter solstice… or en français: le Solstice d'Hiver (see what I did there?). Today is barleywines—perhaps the oldest of old money. The days start getting longer again tomorrow, friends (except for our southern-hemisphere friend(s), of course).

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
