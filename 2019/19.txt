December 19: Two vintages of anything

Today's a little different. We're doubling up for real this time. Let's dig around in our cellars to find two different vintages of any OM beer (though, save your Orvals for tomorrow), and drink them both. This is one of the harder days, but hopefully we'll still see some folks participating. It's a good excuse to see how those cellared favourites are doing.

To participate, drink *two* beers today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
