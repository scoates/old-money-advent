December 16: Old turd you've been looking for an excuse to get out of the cellar

It's finally here! Turd day! ðŸ’© Here's your excuse to dig into the cellar for a bottle that you'd never otherwise drink. Not because it's too precious, not because it's too new or too boring. Maybe you forgot all about this bottle and it's past its prime. Or maybe you wanted to collect a vertical but forgot the next year (or maybe they never made batch 2) and you've been holding onto hope for 14 years. Or maybe it's just a highly questionable bottle that might be amazing, but is probably horrible. Today's the day.

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you donâ€™t have something that matches the theme, donâ€™t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
