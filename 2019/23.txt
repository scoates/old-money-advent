December 23: Cork & Cage (or Cap & Cork)

We're getting close to the end of advent, so it's time to pull out the… uh… fancy bottles. Anything Old Money that has a cork AND another fastener (cage, cap… even a string if you're older Ale Apothecary), 'cause those bottles are *fancy*, right? (-: Really hoping to see an old or new La Folie; I've only ever had the capped version.

To participate, drink a beer today and post in this thread. A photo, a reason you chose this beer, and light tasting notes are all appreciated.

And hey, if you don’t have something that matches the theme, don’t worry about it; just get as close you can and play along anyway.

(In case you missed it, Old Money Advent is a daily drinking thread with two themes: Old Money and something more specific. Check out http://oldmoney.beer/advent for the daily theme calendar.)
